I analyze the Covid-19 pandemic in Penang, Malaysia. This is a work-in-progress as I'm currently learning data analysis using Python in the meantime. This project helps me apply what I've learned and I hope to develop more tools that can be useful for the Penang community to keep up to date with Covid-19.
